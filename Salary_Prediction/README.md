# Salary Prediction Model

This project uses demographic and social data to build and test a classification model in R. The model predicts whether a U.S. adult earns over $50K. Data is cleaned and standardized, exploratory analysis is performed, and a classification tree is created and evaluated.

## Data

adult-test.csv - This file contains the same features as the training dataset, for use in testing and evaluating the model performance with unseen data.
